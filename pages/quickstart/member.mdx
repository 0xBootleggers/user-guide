# Add a Member

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of adding new members to your DAO.

## Accessing Members

1. Navigate to the `Members` tab on your primary DAO page in the navigation bar.

![navigation bar](https://github.com/HausDAO/monorepo/assets/522182/3af8c33b-3baa-4c33-bde4-15efbfd249c7)

This will show you the current list of members in your DAO.

## Add Member

2. Click on the `Add Member` button.

A DAO Token Request proposal will appear.

## Proposal Creation Screen

You'll be directed to the DAO Token Request proposal creation screen.

3. Fill Out the Proposal Form:

### Required Fields

- **Proposal Title**: Provide a unique title for your proposal for easy identification by other DAO members.
- **Description**: Describe the reason for this membership proposal.
- **Recipient**: Enter the wallet address of the prospective member. If you're requesting membership for yourself, add your own address. However, if you're recommending someone else, input their address.
- **Voting Token Requested**: Specify the number of membership shares you are requesting for the individual.
- **Non-Voting Token Requested**: Indicate the number of non-voting loot tokens for the prospective member.

### Optional Fields

- **Link**: If available, add links to supporting documentation for the membership request.
- **Add Expiration Date**: Set a deadline for the proposal.

## Submitting Your Proposal

4. After filling out the necessary fields, click the `Submit` button.

This action will request a signature from your wallet.

5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

A toast notification will appear, confirming the proposal creation or indicating a failure.

You'll be redirected to the proposal queue of your DAO. Your new membership proposal should be prominently displayed at the top.

## Voting on Proposal

It's a recommended practice to vote 'Yes' on your own proposal to increase its chances of passing.

## Proposal Outcome

Once the proposal passes and the grace period ends, the tokens specified in the proposal will be transferred to the recipient's address, officially adding them as a member of the DAO.

Remember to always communicate with your DAO members and encourage them to participate in the voting process to ensure a smooth and efficient membership addition.
