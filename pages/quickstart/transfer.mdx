# Transfer Tokens

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the process of transferring tokens with your DAO. Tokens can be transferred from either the main treasury or sidecar safes.

## Accessing Proposals

1. Navigate to the `Proposals` tab on your primary DAO page in the navigation bar.

A modal will pop up displaying various proposal types.

## Choose Proposal Type

### Required Fields

- **Proposal Title**: Provide a unique title for your proposal for easy identification by other DAO members.
- **Description**: Explain the purpose and actions of the proposal in simple terms.
- **Recipient**: Enter the wallet address that will receive the tokens. This can be your own, another DAO member's, or even an external wallet. Be cautious with this step.
- **Requested ERC20**: Specify the amount of tokens to transfer and select the token type from the dropdown menu.

### Optional Fields

- **Link**: If available, add links to supporting documentation for the membership request.
- **Add Expiration Date**: Set a deadline for the proposal.

## Submitting Your Proposal

4. After filling out the necessary fields, click the `Submit` button.

This action will request a signature from your wallet.

5. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

A toast notification will appear, confirming the proposal creation or indicating a failure.

You'll be redirected to the proposal queue of your DAO. Your new membership proposal should be prominently displayed at the top.

## Voting on Proposal

It's a recommended practice to vote 'Yes' on your own proposal to increase its chances of passing.

## Proposal Outcome

Once the proposal passes and the grace period ends, the tokens specified in the proposal will be transferred to the recipient's address, officially adding them as a member of the DAO.

Remember to always communicate with your DAO members and encourage them to participate in the voting process to ensure the proposal gets the attention and votes it requires.
